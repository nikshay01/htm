Day 13: Caching with Redis

Learn about caching mechanisms using Redis to improve the performance of your Node.js apps.
Day 14: Deployment & Production Setup

Study how to deploy your Node.js application on cloud platforms like Heroku, AWS, or DigitalOcean.
Learn about environment variables, build tools, and managing production servers.
Day 15: Final Project

Build a full-stack application that integrates your backend skills with DSA concepts (e.g., a task manager app, real-time chat app, or job portal with complex querying).
Tips for Success:
Focus on Learning by Doing: Each day, try to complete coding exercises and implement what you learn in real-time. Use platforms like LeetCode, HackerRank, and Codewars to practice.
Balance Theory and Practice: For Node.js, build mini-projects each day to reinforce your learning (e.g., a REST API, a simple blog app, a task manager).
Stay Consistent: Stick to the daily routine for best results, and ensure that you set aside time to review your progress and revise concepts.
With this adjusted plan, you can make significant progress in both DSA and Backend Development with Node.js within 15 days!
